# IoT Escape Room Roadmap
 
- **May, 2017:** Assemble teams and resources for designing your IoT escape room. If you live in a place with a lot of local makerspaces and/or interest in this project, consider organizing a meet-up from 9-5, local time, each day of the sprint for face-to-face work.
- **May 31, 2017:** Finish assembling teams and resources for the IoT Escape Room challenge. Post questions about the project or to-dos to the  Mozilla Privacy Arcade repo.
- **June 1-2, 2017:** During the sprint, brainstorm, draft, and iterate on your IoT escape room design, facilitation guide, and story (or narrative).
- **June, 2017:** Project leads curate and share exemplar projects online.
- **Summer, 2017:** Contributors prototype and test IoT escape rooms at local libraries and makerspaces.
- **Summer, 2017:** Project leads help interested community members submit their designs as sessions for the Privacy & Security space at this yearâ€™s MozFest.
- **October 27-29, 2017:** MozFest. Project contributors who cannot attend might plan to run local IoT escape room events or to set up an IoT escape room as a MozFest Fringe Event.
