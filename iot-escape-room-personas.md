# IoT Escape Room Challenge Personas

A persona is

- An imaginary user.
- Based on observations or understandings of actual potential or current users.
- Detailed enough so it feels real to the designer, so they can imagine the persona’s needs and responses to a product or project.

Think of what brings you to this project and drives you to contribute. Look for allies and potential project recruits like these who might join you!

***Jenny is a an artist and technologist*** who works on commissioned projects involving IoT. She discovers the Global Sprint and IoT Escape Room Challenge thanks to personal outreach from a staffer at Mozilla. She reaches out to frequent collaborators and a local library to organize a small meet-up to prototype an escape room during the sprint.

***Erika is a librarian who works on youth programming.*** She discovers the Global Sprint and IoT Escape Room Challenge through a tweet from one of her favorite librarians. She brings the idea to her supervisor and asks to hold a meet-up at the library during the sprint and to invite in a few colleagues, local youth initiative staffers, and frequent patrons of her library’s youth programming to work on a design, facilitation guide, and story for an IoT escape room. Erika would love to find help building the room afterwards and proposing it as a MozFest session she and her local youth patrons could facilitate.

***Deandre runs a local makerspace*** that offers thematic, all-ages workshops once a month that are open to the public. A local Mozillian shows him the Global Sprint website and IoT Escape Room Challenge in April. Deandre decides to make June’s theme IoT and to host a meet-up for the IoT Escape Room Challenge and begins promoting the event to members, on the makerspace’s website, and throughout his local network of technologists and librarians.
